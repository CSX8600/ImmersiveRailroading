The Boiler Roller turns Boiler Plates created in the [link{immersiverailroading:plate-rolling-machine}]Plate Rolling Machine[link{}] into the needed boiler pieces for a given steam locomotive.

A Boiler Roller needs a clear space that is 6 blocks wide, 8 blocks deep, and 1 block high. When placed, it is centered on the left-middle block of the 6 block width. Placing the machine requires 24 Stone Slabs, 4 Heavy Engineering Blocks, and 8 Light Engineering Blocks.

To operate, the machine needs RF power, which is input through the orange-yellow colored block on the left front of the machine. The roller creates the appropriate part automatically - just have a boilerplate in hand and right-click the machine. After a few moments, the flat plate will be rolled - right-click the machine with an empty hand to pick it up.
