The Casting Basin requires a clear space 7 blocks wide, 24 blocks long, and 9 blocks high to place. It needs 114 Stone Bricks, 15 Heavy Engineering Blocks, 126 blocks of Sand, 86 Blast Bricks, and 64 Steel Blocks.

Placement is centered on the shorter, 7-block side, and the machine is assembled by right-clicking it anywhere with a Large Wrench.

Power is input through the top of the machine, on the color-coded orange block.

The Basin creates different parts for rolling stock, specifically wheels and frames, as well as the Rail Cast for use with the [link{immersiverailroading:track-roller}]Track Roller[link{}]. The Gauge selector changes between gauges.

To create a selected part, drop Steel Blocks into the Basin and make sure it has power. The part will be created in short order - right-click on the Basin with an empty slot to retrieve the part.
