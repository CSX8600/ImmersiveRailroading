The Steam Hammer is used to process some parts before they are placed onto a Frame. The machine is built from 3 Heavy Engineering Blocks, 1 Steel Block, 1 Piston, and 10 Light Engineering Blocks. It is the smallest machine in Immersive Railroading, requiring a mere 5 blocks in width, 1 in depth, and 6 in height. When placed, it is centered on the middle of the 5 blocks in front of the player.

Operating the Steam Hammer requires power, which is input through the top block. To operate the hammer, right-click the central block to open the GUI. Place the item that should be processed in the left slot, and after a few moments it will move to the right slot, which means it is now ready for use.
